# Image_Manipulation

This project is a part from Algorithms and Data Structures course at UBC. The main approach for image manipulation splits an image into smaller block and rearrange those block by linked lists.
When blocks changing their positions, an image will be reassembled by changing RGB pixels to create visual results

To implement features, the project applied 2D vector, linked lists and management of dynamic memory.

### Note
This project is still in progress to add more features such as horizontal rotation and flip image
